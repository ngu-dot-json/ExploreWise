# ExploreWise

ExploreWise is a hypothetical Calgary-based travel startup company that provides the best and most up-to-date travel recommendations and information for its clients. 
This includes assistance in choosing a travel location, finding interesting events around an area, itinerary management, budget tracking, and more. 
Clients seek out these services well before their trip in their initial planning phase where they work out the logistics of their trip. 

ExploreWise is looking to expand its services provided to clients by taking advantage of increased ownership of personal devices 
and how travelers are opting to use online tools to create their personalized travel itineraries instead of using the likes of travel books or brochures. 
Therefore, ExploreWise wants to expand its services provided to clients by creating an online travel planner website that can be used before, during, and after a trip. 


## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project, written in JavaScript and using the React framework. Next.js is a React framework that enables server-side rendering and other 
optimizations for React applications.

First, ensure you are in the /Codebase/my-project directory. Then, install any missing dependencies
```bash
npm install
```
Then, run the development server
install 
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
